title: "Probing Negation in Language Models"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2023-10-01-probe-neg
excerpt: 'We hypothesize about why pretrained LMs are inconsistent under negation: when the statement could refer to multiple ground entities with conflicting properties, negation may not entail a change in output. This means negation minimal pairs in different training samples can have the same completion in pretraining corpora.'
