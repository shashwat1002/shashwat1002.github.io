I am an AI research student, currently pursuing an Undergrad + MS by Research program at IIIT Hyderabad under Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru. I am interested in how dense representations encode the complexity of the world. I often think about what are the 'atomic concepts' large foundational models pick up from their data and how the composition of these concepts manifests in their outputs. My approach to this comes from the angle of generalization in training and post-facto control or interpretability of large models.

Some topics I like to dabble in

- Post-facto interpretability and controllability of pretrained models
- Science of pretraining 

In my free time, I like to read about history and watch movies. I can recite the lines of Django Unchained :).

I have had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Shauli Ravfogel](https://shauli-ravfogel.netlify.app/), [Dr. Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/), [Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/), [Dr. Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/), [Saujas Vaduguru](https://saujasv.github.io/), and [Shashwat Goel](https://shash42.github.io/). Under their mentorship and guidance I have worked on project topics including, interpretability of Language Model representations, training dynamics, diffusion, and vision-language models.
