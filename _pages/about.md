I am an AI research student, currently pursuing an Undergrad + MS by Research program at IIIT Hyderabad under my advisor Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru. I am interested in the science of Deep Learning, AI interpretability, and pretraining. 

Some specific ideas I find interesting are:

- Post-facto interpretability and controllability of pretrained models.
- Disentanglement of 'atomic concepts' in dense representations and their composition.
- Pretraining tasks for efficient and generalizable learning.

In my free time, I like to read about history and watch movies. I love Pirates of the Caribbean :)


# Publications

I have had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Shauli Ravfogel](https://shauli-ravfogel.netlify.app/), [Dr. Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/), [Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/), [Dr. Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/), [Saujas Vaduguru](https://saujasv.github.io/), and [Shashwat Goel](https://shash42.github.io/). Under their mentorship and guidance I have worked on project topics including interpretability of Language Model representations, training dynamics, diffusion, and vision-language models.
