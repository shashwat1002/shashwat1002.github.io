I am an AI research student, doing a PhD at the [CDS](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) to work with [Dr. He He](https://hhexiy.github.io/) and [Dr. Tal Linzen](https://tallinzen.net/). Before this, I completed an Undergrad + MS by Research program at IIIT Hyderabad under my advisor Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru. I am interested in multimodality, AI interpretability, and the science of Deep Learning. 

Some specific ideas I find interesting are:

- Multimodal training for more holistic models. 
- Post-facto interpretability and controllability of pretrained models.
- Pretraining tasks for efficient and generalizable learning.

In my free time, I like to read about history and watch movies. I love Pirates of the Caribbean :)


# Publications

I have had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Shauli Ravfogel](https://shauli-ravfogel.netlify.app/), [Dr. Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/), [Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://precog.iiit.ac.in/), [Dr. Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/), [Saujas Vaduguru](https://saujasv.github.io/), and [Shashwat Goel](https://shash42.github.io/). Under their mentorship and guidance I have worked on project topics including interpretability of Language Model representations, training dynamics, diffusion, and vision-language models.
